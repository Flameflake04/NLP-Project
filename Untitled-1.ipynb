And a country is going to accept those people that would've arrived on the boat. The problem is that there isn't a safe way to transport poor people. They can't simply buy a plane ticket.

If the news decided to run stories about kidnappings, they could very easily have the country go into a panic over that.

We don't even get a fair representation of happenings. Instead, we get a skewed view to press a political hot button and not giving a fair understanding of the incidents.\", 'Right.

Only emotions and strawmen do.', \"I couldn't agree more. Just like more blacks kill one another than are shot by cops, but we make it out as if the only people killing black people are cops. I wish we would get a better representation of facts in the media to educate people. That was how media was supposed to work. These days it seems more like they simply want to grab headlines and push political agendas.\", \"Yeah, I think it's pretty sad.  The other thing I say to people is to use their own experiences to guide their beliefs more than stuff they see on screens.  How many hundreds of thousands of POSITIVE, PRODUCTIVE, LEGAL, and APPROPRIATE police encounters occur each day for every one that goes horribly wrong?  Again, a cop might shoot and murder an innocent civilian, but that's not our reality.  The event might be the truth.  But it's not representative of the true state of the nation and what the vast, vast, vast majority of people experience in their lives instead of on screens.\", \"I couldn't have said it better myself. We tend to take the extreme cases that make the headlines and make that the normal reality when it is far from the truth. I just recently saw a video of a black man with a knife. He was ordered to drop it and continued to advance on the cop. The man was shot several times, went down and then jumped back up. He attacked a second officer before he was finally taken down. That video didn't make headlines to show how often cops have little choice but to defend themselves.\", \"Yeah, precisely.  I also ask myself in these issues, how much danger do we expect these cops to put themselves in?  How close to certain death do we expect them to come before they're allowed to defend themselves?  I'm sorry but it's not hard to get a cop not to abuse you: do what he says.  They don't have any more desire to get violent than you do.\", \"I've said the same thing many times myself. I've had interactions with cops and never had any violence or threat of violence. If an officer asks you to do something, do it! That's what I was taught growing up. Respect authority figures. Instead, today everyone thinks they don't have to listen to anyone. They don't respect authority. They want to live stream it and get reactions on social media.\", 'Yes, I think that teachers and principals have largely abdicated their authority and influence.  Heck, even parents, who often seem more intent on being friends than authority figures to their children.', \"Well we don't enforce any rules on children anymore. We don't punish them. We give them time outs, as if that will teach them anything. I got spanked a few times growing up and I learned how to behave. Yes, some children were abused, but the majority of parents used spanking properly and taught children how to behave. Now, kids threaten to call CPS on parents if they don't get their way.\", \"Yes, I think it's sad an ironic.  I often wonder how a generation of people who were spanked but couldn't possibly believe they were abused, could go on to think spanking is so wrong.  I have a theory but it'd take too long to discuss here.  Just a weird irony, in my opinion.\", \"Yeah, it's just crazy.  Even the people who believe that's how it should be can't help offending people.  There's always someone who's going to be offended.  We should be teaching people to be responsible and resilient, not to see themselves as victims.\", \"It's back to that everyone get's a trophy theory. We suddenly can't disappoint anyone. Life is full of disappointment. We can't always have our own way. We're supposed to live by the majority rules theory. However, even in politics we see people forget that. Instead, don't like the president, then refuse to accept him. It's crazy. I've voted for plenty of people that didn't win elections but still respected those that did.\", \"Absolutely.  And the ultimate irony is that by trying to make everyone's life struggle-free, we increase their struggles by making everyone less capable of dealing with them.  We know it's unhealthy and unproductive to treat kids like this, make them soft and feeble.  It's not just silly, it's actually detrimental to the people we're trying to protect.\", \"Exactly! Instead of letting them learn when they're young and the disappointments are more minor that they can survive not always getting what they want. We let them grow up thinking everything should go their way. Then suddenly, they don't get into the college they want or get the job they want and they can't deal with it.\", \"Yeah, it's a bizarre tack we've taken and I wonder when it or if we'll change course.
