| what did you think about this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         1 |                   1 |         1 |
| It's definitely really sad to read, considering everything they're all going through. What did you think?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         3 |                   2 |         4 |
| I think it's super sad... they seem to never catch a break, always struggling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         4 |                   2 |         5 |
| I can't imagine just living in an area that is constantly being ravaged by hurricanes or earthquakes. I take my location for granted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         3 |                   2 |         5 |
| Me too.. I also can't imagine living in the poverty and such.. It's crazy to think that people still live like that sometimes.  The gap between first world countires and places like that is crazy to em                                                                                                                                                                                               |         3 |                   2 |         5 |
| It also seems unnecessary for there to even be such a gap. With all of the wealthy countries out there, I hope Haiti gets the help it deserves, because we, and other countries, can certainly afford it.                                                                                                                                                                                               |         2 |                   2 |         3 |
| Agreed... with how frivilous and unnessary our spending is, it's so sad that countries like that don't get more support or guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         3 |                   2 |         3 |
| It's disheartening, isn't it? Places have the ability, money, time, and knowledge, and still refuse to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         4 |                   2 |         4 |
| It is so sad... Or even the millionaires/billionaires out there. I know some of them donate, but at some point, you can only spend so much money. Why not put it to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         3 |                   2 |         4 |
| Yep, exactly. It's just very frustrating overall. I think it's hard for others because they don't understand until their houses are being swept away for torrential floods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         3 |                   2 |         3 |
| It is hard to fathom/process, it's hard for me to really imagine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         3 |                   2 |         4 |
| Give it twenty more years, for the more compassionate people to come into leadership. I think we'll see a big difference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         2 |                   0 |         4 |
| I think that is a fair statement... the new generation seems more caring and compassionate and willing to help                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         2 |                   0 |         3 |
| I know it sounds cold, but the older generation either doesn't care, or doesn't want to understand. Trust me, we'll see some major change soon enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         2 |                   2 |         3 |
| I totally agree... I know there are some out there that care, but the majority, and the ones in charge, really don't seem to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         3 |                   2 |         3 |
| Well, it was really great talking to you. I can't think of anything else to say about the topic. goodbye                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         2 |                   1 |         1 |

| I apologize, I thought we did! I'm obviously a winner at counting. Hurricane Matthew was two years ago, wasn't it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         1 |                   1 |         2 |
| Haha no worries, we should be there now. That sounds about right to me, crazy, time flies, seems like I was just hearing about it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         2 |                   1 |         1 |
| I think I recall it spawning a second hurricane, too, but it calmed down before being too bad. Yeah, I was definitely a few lines off lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         2 |                   1 |         2 |

| Yes it is. The people there need a lot of help. What do you think are some of the best ways to get them the help they need                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| I think if the UN is able to get them the required funds that will help a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         2 |                   0 |         3 |
| I am inclined to disagree. More money is only a temporary solution. I think they need lasting change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         2 |                   2 |         3 |
| Yes, I hear there is a lot of corruption there as well, that is also a problem. Money is short term                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         2 |                   2 |         4 |
| Yes corruption is a huge problem. I think the NGO's and the UN should focus more on teaching the Haitian people to help themselves and develop the country                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         2 |                   2 |         2 |
| Yes getting a better government is the best way to help any region. Most countries, do not absolutely need outside for every disaster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| I don't think the US wants a ''better'' government. They want a government they can control or influence. Corruption helps with that agenda                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         3 |                   2 |         2 |
| Yes two things can be true at once though. They want a better government but also try to get power and control in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| Do you think the United States has a vested interest in a developed and autonomous Haiti? I don't think so                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         2 |                   2 |         1 |

So you think the change should come from within?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| Yes. I think that is the only way to get lasting long term and meaningful change. We have to help them help themselves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         3 |                   0 |         2 |
| Yes that is why I think giving them aid, with no strings attached, is a good way to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         3 |                   0 |         3 |
| I disagree. With all the corruption it would just be money wasted. We should control the funds and focus more on sending people and material                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         3 |                   2 |         2 |
| Yeah but you can not have it both ways, either we send money and get power and control, or we send it no strings attached. So I think there might have to be strings actually, as you reminded me of the corruption.                                                                                                                                                                                    |         3 |                   1 |         2 |
| Some other questions would be how much money and how long would we have to be involved?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         2 |                   1 |         1 |
| I think the article said the UN was looking to send $800 million. No more then ten years in my opinion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         1 |                   1 |         2 |
| I think 10 years is a good figure. But it seems like any problems Haiti has are only made worse by natural disasters. And no one can stop those                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         3 |                   1 |         2 |
| Yes there will always be disasters. Until the core problem of the country is fixed, I think we will always have to be ready to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         3 |                   1 |         2 |
| That might take a lot longer than 10 years. It might be a good idea if the UN established permanent or semi permanent facilitiesc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| Yes I think if we could supply them advisers and disaster professionals they could greatly benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         2 |                   0 |         2 |
| True, but who would want to go there long term? I know I wouldn't. It's so far away and so different                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         2 |                   1 |         2 |
| I probably would not. We would have to compensate those individuals well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         2 |                   1 |         2 |
| The compensation would have to be high to motivate the right people                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| Yeah but I think the fact they would be helping those in need, could also be a motivation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         2 |                   0 |         2 |

| It's pretty stressful when hurricanes hit. I once stayed for one even though we were supposed to evacuate, nobody was hurt but it was a scary experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         3 |                   2 |         2 |
| I have been near tornadoes and they look bad enough.

| It's scary because all you can do is hide in your home hoping it passes by without doing much damage.

| I follow college basketball like a crazy person.   Skal Labiesse was trapped in the hurricane in this article.   His whole home collapsed on him and he was covered with rock and materials for three days.   His story is so frightening.

| He must had a lot of trust for the driver of the boat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         2 |                   0 |         3 |
| I dont know how the driver managed to hit the rocks at full speed. Youd have to see something like that coming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         2 |                   2 |         2 |

| Exactly. He was so young too. I can't even fathom losing a son so young. Parents should never have to bury their children but you hear it happening almost every day these days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         4 |                   2 |         4 |

| No, it's really not. You take each day for granted. I am in a season of my life where I just keep wishing the days away and hoping time speeds up. But it's no way to live because you miss the small moments!                                                                                                                                                                                          |         4 |                   2 |         2 |
| I totally agree. If you don't mind me asking , why are you hoping time speeds up?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         2 |                   1 |         2 |

| Thank you much. It's a great thing but just exhausting as expected!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         3 |                   0 |         1 |
| I can't even imagine! But back to the sotry, i hope the family is fine now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| Yes, that would be a hard loss. Unexpected deaths are obviously way harder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         3 |                   2 |         4 |
| True. I heard of KINDA a similar incident with a football player that got into an accident and lost his arm. It's all so terrible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         4 |                   2 |         3 |
| Oh man. Especially when someone does it for a living, it's hard to have any sort of life altering injury. It definitely crushes their spirits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         3 |                   2 |         3 |
| For sure! It's very heartbreaking.

| Sad about what happened to those guys.  I hope no one makes this about alcohol or anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         2 |                   2 |         3 |

| Right. I can't imagine being his family either.  To see their child go like that after being so successful has to sting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         3 |                   2 |         3 |

| I don't remember if it said so in the article or not, but was it night when they ran into the rocks? I just don't get why they didn't see them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         3 |                   1 |         3 |

| At least it was probably instant.  They probably had no idea the rocks were there and absolutely flew into them without any chance to realize what was going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         2 |                   1 |         4 |

| Lol I think it would suck more to come out of a coma.  When you're in it you have no idea.  I would hate coming out of one and realizing you lost a month of your life or something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         3 |                   2 |         3 |

| I feel like there's lots of stories out there about people saying they saw everything but from the third person perspective or things like that. Other people say it was just the deepest sleep they've ever had.                                                                                                                                                                                       |         2 |                   1 |         1 |

| For real.  Obviously they don't know everything about it, but it blows my mind when I watch docs or something where people are breaking down the parts of the brain...

| Yea my job is to get all the instruments ready and basically be an extra pair of hands for the surgeon handing him all the instruments and helping him with the surgery. A good surgical tech knows the surgery just as well as the surgeon so he/she never has to ask for anything you should anticipate it                                                                                            |         2 |                   1 |         1 |
| Yeah I here ya, probably makes the operation flow a lot smoother when the surgeon asks for a tool and you're not fumblefuckin around looking to find the blahblahmeter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         2 |                   1 |         1 |

| Maybe my cousin is just a sociopath.

| I always think stories of foster kids are pretty sad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         2 |                   2 |         4 |
| I agree... it's such a bad system sometimes and it breaks my heart, cause they are kids                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         2 |                   2 |         4 |
| Of course the kids make matters worse with delinquency, but that's not unexpected behavior considering their experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         3 |                   1 |         4 |
| Agreed, I'm sure he would be less likely to do that if he  had grown up in more stable conditions. It seems a lot of times the foster care system puts them in a situation that is just as bad or worse then where they wer ebefore                                                                                                                                                                     |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| Yes, although even in good situations it sometimes doesn't work.  I knew an adopted boy and girl who'd come from a very violent background.  They destroyed the adoptive family they were brought into.  The damage had already been done to them as people.                                                                                                                                            |         2 |                   2 |         3 |
| Oh that's so sad... My neighbors did foster care a lot, and they were a great family. but man some of the kids you could tell had been through some shit and they were so angry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         3 |                   1 |         4 |
| Yeah, bless the people who are willing to do that.  And I'm sure most have good intentions.  But it's definitely a tough situation for everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         3 |                   0 |         4 |
| Agreed, I'm sure it would put a strain on any family or couple, especially if the kids are a handful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| At least there was something of a silver lining in this story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         2 |                   0 |         3 |
| for sure! I just wish he could have been helped out more in the process, or for it to be easier on him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| Yes, although I'd also go back to the mother and say the problem starts there. The mother (and probably father) were the first to let the kids down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         3 |                   1 |         4 |
| Agreed.... I can't imagine being that kind of parent. i don't get people who are. But there seems to be so many                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         3 |                   1 |         3 |
| Yes, unfortunately.  It's very easy to have children but not so easy to raise them well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         3 |                   2 |         2 |
| For sure... But it should be worth it to raise them well, it's your responsibility for having kids                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         2 |                   2 |         2 |
| Absolutely, I agree.  I think if you have children you owe them that.  And most people resent their parents enough you'd think they'd try harder with their own kids.  But few do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         2 |                   1 |         2 |
| For sure... it seems everyone has parent problems, but then seem to end up parenting the same way                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         2 |                   0 |         3 |
| It's a strange phenomenon.  At least to me.  But we're often more creatures of habit and genetics and convenience than of thoughtful consideration and values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         2 |                   0 |         3 |
| That is a great way to phrase it... It's very interesting for sure. Especially when you have 18+years to change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         2 |                   0 |         3 |

| I think it's sad that a kid would have to go through all that...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         3 |                   2 |         4 |
| It's terrible! I feel so bad for the kid because he should be in school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         4 |                   2 |         4 |
| Agreed, he should just be allowed to be a kid and not have to deal with all that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         3 |                   1 |         4 |
| He probably was terrified and is going to be scarred for life now..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         4 |                   2 |         4 |
| Oh yah, he'll definitly have the trauma of it all to deal with the rest of his life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         3 |                   2 |         4 |
| Do you think jail can really change the kid for the better?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         1 |                   1 |         2 |
| I think he needs therapy and guidance and  a stable home more so than punishment/jail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| I agree. I have a cousin that went to jail before for stealing and he's the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         2 |                   1 |         2 |

| Pretty much. He just hasn't improved for the better and jail didn't really help him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         2 |                   1 |         1 |

| The kid should be out making friends and playing video games.. not rotting in jail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         3 |                   1 |         3 |
| I agree... It's so sad because he has already missed out on so so much of his childhood, and had it be horrible, and now this. He just needs a break and someone who actually cares about him                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         3 |                   2 |         3 |
| Hopefully he finds a girl he can marry that cares about him because his family doesnt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         3 |                   0 |         3 |
| I hope so too, and that he is able to hold a healthy relationship                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         3 |                   0 |         3 |
| It just makes you wonder how many other children are out there being put in cells..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         2 |                   1 |         3 |

| I didn't know that coal mining had such adverse effects on the environment. No wonder everyone wants green energy so badly...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         3 |                   2 |         2 |
| I feel bad for the people and the wild life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         3 |                   2 |         5 |
| Yeah for sure. The people are going to get all sorts of health problems and the animals are so desperate for food that they are attacking humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         4 |                   2 |         5 |
| I can not believe how little they said they are going to pay the people for lost of land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         4 |                   2 |         4 |
| Yeah, it did seem little but Indians don't really make much money daily, compared to western countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         2 |                   2 |         3 |
| That is true. I wonder what other animals besides the elephants are effected?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| I imagine it's every animal in the surroundings. It's just that only elephants are big and strong enough to do something about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         2 |                   1 |         2 |
| It has to be really bad growing up next to the coal mine with the bad air quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         3 |                   2 |         3 |
| Yeah and the lack of water too. They spoke about their wells drying up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         3 |                   2 |         3 |

| Maybe it's a matter of corruption? Since the officials didn't even make good on their promises regarding money for the land and work for one of the landowners sons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         2 |                   2 |         2 |
| Corruption and greed, but that is not just in India.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         3 |                   2 |         2 |
| True, so many other places mine coal still though, including America. Do you think our coal mines are this bad?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         2 |                   2 |         1 |
| No, not as bad because of regulations, but I would not want to live next to one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         2 |                   2 |         1 |
| That's true, I wonder what regulations can do to prevent all the ash though?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         2 |                   1 |         1 |

| That's good. One of the worst parts of that article was reading about the white ash covering everything. Reading about it might've been enough to give me cancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         3 |                   2 |         2 |

| That's sad.

| True. Squeeze all the money you can out of the land without caring about the people, animals or general environment until it's too late.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         2 |                   2 |         2 |

What do you think can be done on the part of the citizens in order to draw attention of the international communities?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         2 |                   1 |         3 |
| Any change with government happens when people join together en mass. They need to be protesting outside of every politicians office. They should also spread this story to the international community to publicly shame their officials.

| I can think of how in the US change was created with the civil rights movement, and the women's movement when people stood together. I think that because people like us know about the story we can help by sharing this information on social media. We can be the media for them. But what can be done about the poor elephants? They have lost their homes because of the forest's being destroyed. |         3 |                   1 |         3 |

| Ultimately yes. So it's up to everyone to make sure their government works in their best interest. Some people not even receiving compensation was terrible, but what about the kids who lost their lives? No amount of money can replace life.                                                                                                                                                         |         4 |                   1 |         3 |

| It sucks that the people who don't even work in the mines are getting such bad lung diseases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         2 |                   2 |         3 |
| Yeah. It's bad enough when things like this affect people actually involved, but when you have people getting hurt that weren't even part of it it's just so much worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         3 |                   2 |         3 |

| I wouldn't be surprised; many animals have similar lung structures as humans do. It's probably why the elephants etc. have been in so many altercations lately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         2 |                   2 |         3 |
| Like I said, can't get too mad because American used a lot of coal in the 1800s and early to mid 1900s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         2 |                   1 |         2 |
| Oh for sure. Many of the appalachian areas, for example, still have serious environmental damages and generational health issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         2 |                   1 |         3 |

| Yeah. Economics & tradition -- many families have been in the business for so long they can't imagine doing anything else.

| I was not really bothered, suicides are common                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         1 |                   2 |         2 |
| common?  I guess.  I don't really see it as an everyday occurence but anyhow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         3 |                   1 |         2 |
| No not everyday but people do it and that is their choice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         1 |                   2 |         2 |
| Yep, it is definitely their choice.  I still find it sad and very avoidable.  How sad for all their remaining family members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         3 |                   2 |         4 |
| I see what you mean but don't you think that being sad is just a waste of time?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         1 |                   2 |         2 |
| Of course being sad is a waste of time, but it is still appropriate to feel sadness when you hear of a tragedy.  It's not like I'm dressed in black lighting candles and mourning, Jesus Christ.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         4 |                   1 |         3 |
| Easy now. I did not mean it as a personal attack. It just doesn't make sense to me to be sad for someone who makes a conscious choice to end their own life. It's their choice                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         2 |                   2 |         2 |
| Well then be neutral towards it or happy, that's your right.  I find it sad anytime I hear about a tragedy that happens to others.  I am sad for their family who lost a beloved family member.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         4 |                   2 |         3 |
| Let me be clear, I would rather no one commit suicide. How do we know that they were beloved? They could have despised each other                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         1 |                   2 |         1 |
| Sure they could have, but surely there was at least one person who appreciated this woman.  The article stated as much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         3 |                   1 |         3 |
| A fair point. When you think about it suicide is the easy way out. It is a bit cowardly. Choosing to continue living requires real courage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         2 |                   1 |         1 |
| I agree suicide is extremely cowardly and suicide angers me.  It is a terrible choice for people to make and very selfish bc they are not considering how their actions affect others who are left behind.                                                                                                                                                                                              |         4 |                   1 |         2 |
| We can agree on that. Do you know anyone personally who committed suicide?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         2 |                   0 |         2 |
| Yes, and dealing with the fallout from it and the years and years of aftermath from that person's loved ones was terrible and very straining on everyone around.  The loved ones are STILL not healed and it has been 13 years                                                                                                                                                                          |         3 |                   1 |         2 |
| I got that impression from your responses. Do you think the loved ones deserve treatment or should preventative measures be the answer to suicide?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         1 |                   1 |         1 |
| Can you clarify your question?  I am not sure I fully understand.  Do you mean grief counseling, or what preventative measures are you referring to?  Like should more have been done to try to help the person to start with?                                                                                                                                                                          |         1 |                   1 |         1 |
| Hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, or even depriving someone of their freedom temporarily to ensure they do not take their life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         1 |                   1 |         2 |
| I think those are reasonable steps to take in some cases but in others it might just make things worse.  I really don't know the answer to that.  If someone is that determined to take their own life it seems they will do it no matter what.  What do you think?  I don't think any of that stuff would have helped int he situation I'm referring to.  But who knows.                               |         2 |                   1 |         2 |
| What do you think causes suicide? Most animals have such a strong will to live. What causes people to abandon or ignore that innate drive?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         1 |                   1 |         1 |
| That's an interesting point about animals.  We don't see them giving up and killing themselves.  Fascinating question, I have no idea what it is about humans.  Maybe it has just become a part of our culture?  Like if the first animal did it then others would follow?  No clues.  What do you think                                                                                                |         2 |                   1 |         2 |
| I am not sure myself. Most animals also do not have complex social structures and constructs like humans. I am sure that with those stark differences it would be good place to start the investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                |         1 |                   1 |         2 |
| Yes I wonder if it has ever been formally studied                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         1 |                   1 |         1 |
| I was wondering that myself. I think the best animals to study would be primates. I know chimpanzees can suffer from depression but I am not sure whether or not they commit suicide                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         1 |                   1 |         2 |
| OH yeah, really good point.  That would be very interesting to find out.  I guess it would be possible that they could because they do a lot of things that we do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         2 |                   0 |         2 |
| True, but they also don't do a lot of things we do and I am not sure whether or not suicide is in the Do or Don't category.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         1 |                   1 |         2 |
| yeah exactly.  It is probably in the don't category.  I guess I could see them like refusing to eat or drink more than bringing a knife to their wrist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         1 |                   1 |         2 |
