| That's good, so I guess we are supposed to discuss the article. I wonder, if my family or I were in a place where my very life was at risk, what would I do?                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Yes, I think it is something most people rather not imagine. But it is a reality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Yes, it is sad for those who have to make hard decision. Sad also to hear people be so unsympathetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Yes and why is America taking so few refugees?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Not sure, I guess refugees are not top priority for anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Me either, I would like to think I would do anything to help my family and survive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Of course!

| Such a tragedy. My first reaction was sadness.

| It is indeed a tragedy. My first reaction was surprise, given the number of people that perished. I also feel for their families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Yes, surprise I felt that way too. I wonder what type of fire they said in the article that was burning near the tanker to cause it to explode and then they said another theory was a lightning strike. What do you think?                                                                                                                                               |
| Lightning strike would be incredibly unlucky and uncommon. The article didn't seem to lean towards either theory. What do you think might have been the cause?                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Yeah, I see a lightning strike unlikely. They would use that as a reason I don't think I would believe that honestly. And there's no details though enough for me to even judge that I guess. They didn't really give too many details.                                                                                                                                   |
| Yes, either way incredibly unfortunate. They stated that over a hundred people were injured in addition to the 73 that died and many tried to get to a nearby river. I'm sure the truth will come out with that many witnesses.                                                                                                                                           |
| yes whenever I read that part man, I cannot even imagine, trying to get into a river on fire that would just be god-awful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Yes, it made me think of some war photos that I have seen with bodies in vehicles from people that also died to I believe a bombing. I wonder who will be held responsible.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| yeah, I know what you mean on that part. I wonder something this place it doesn't really say where it is besides the name Mozambique is that a region known for terrorist attacks?                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| I'm not familiar with that region. I believe they said the tanker was from a nearby city. I'm guessing that it occurred on something like a highway or interstate given that the number of people that had to have been in the vicinity seemed quite large.                                                                                                               |
| I guess Google says that it is a country in east Africa the countries, 35th largest country                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Yeah, I am not familiar with it at all besides knowing that it is in Africa. I do wonder if it could have been a terrorist attack. That would be a real shame.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| I also fetched info off of Google for that just now it says:  Mozambique is still grappling with a military insurgency in parts of the gas-rich province of Cabo-Delgado; the four-year conflict has caused an estimated 4,000 deaths and displaced nearly one million people. How to see what year there's articles from that I'm looking at, but it isn't even on there |
| I can't imagine living somewhere like that. I wonder what leads to something like that being allowed to happen. What is their government doing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Makes me thankful to be living in the USA every single day that's for sure!...(btw plz excuse my grammar mistakes and miss spellings and typos I'd like to blame it on my keyboard, but I just cannot do that.lol bcse it's totally me, but I know how to spell very clearly, but my hands are functioning today.)                                                        |
| No problem, I type faster than I should and often make mistakes. Yes, we have our own share of problems here but I am also thankful to be here. Makes me feel helpless sometimes hearing about these tragedies and not being able to do anything about it.                                                                                                                |
| amen to that. You hit the nail on the head. We all have our own share of problems and i know there's somebody out there that always has it worse so whenever I get down on myself, I try to remember that it could always be worse.                                                                                                                                       |
| Yes, whenever something like this really makes you think and trivializes everyday problems. It makes me thankful for what I have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Exactly! I may not have much, but I consider myself rich, because I am thankful for every single thing that I have. That's the truth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| That is an eloquent way of putting it. I do hope that someday people that suffer like that will have only mostly trivial problems to worry about like I do.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Right on! totally agree with you! Guess that only thing I feel like I can do is just say a prayer for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| A lot of times you hear stories like this in the news there is no clue given how to send support. I wish that there was a real way to send a donation or something. But, how would that even help really?                                                                                                                                                                 |
| If you donate to the right charity, and do our research about it, like the Red Cross, they are well known, and very credible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| That is true. I am sure that there is an organization there like the Red Cross. I imagine that they are still there helping people to rebuild their lives afterwards. It is a really selfless pursuit that people that work in those organization undertake.                                                                                                              |
| yes, the Red Cross is everywhere, and they go everywhere. All kinds of countries and help and all kinds of circumstances and I just noticed the time we're almost out of time and we still gotta do two messages each.                                                                                                                                                    |
| I remember Red Cross always have a donation stand outside of stores but haven't seen one in probably over a decade. I guess the way to make donations now is directly or online. Thanks for the chat and sharing your perspective.                                                                                                                                        |
| oh wow really? I miss seeing the Salvation Army at Christmas time ringing the bell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| I still do see the Salvation Army outside of stores during the Holidays.

| yeag, but everywhere you goyou will probably effect some kind of animal.

| Yup. I dig. I thought that the article was oddly written, but I caught the main idea of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| I am glad I am not the only one who had a hard time understanding it.

| Sure, It was written and then translated badly, I think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| yes, deinfitely not written by a native English speaker.  what would else could you gather though. I always wonder why peopel who believe in evolution try so hard to preserve species when it kind of goes against the whole idea. Maybe they could involve into something better adapted                                                                                |
| What I get is that the apes (orangutans) are already at a 1700 population and then some kind of development for transport (or something) is being planned.
